        <p>The first concert I ever went to was Styx. It was the year 2001 and I was 13 years old. It was my dad and I 
            that went. I remember the band was absolutely fantastic. I could not believe how the lead singer could sing,
            play the guitar, and use a keyboard with his feet all at the same time, when its all i can do to walk and chew gum without choking. It was at the ampitheater in Earth City. I'll never forget that the guy sitting in front of us drank so much he was passed out 
            before Styx even came on stage. </p>        
        
        <h2>Linkin Park, (hed) pe, The Apex Theory</h2>

        <p>This concert was absolutely amazing, every band that played killed it and rocked the whole arena. The first 
            band to play was The Apex Theory, I've never heard of them before and I never heard of them again but they 
            were really good. The next bad to play was (hed) planet earth, I only knew a couple of thier songs (I 
            listened to more of their music recently and I see why my dad wouldn't really let me listen to them then) 
            but they were awesome too. Then of course Linkin Park came out, there were mosh pits, crowd surfing and I 
            did a ton of yelling and singing along. The energy in the Family Arena is something that made me love going 
            to concerts. It's not really somethig that you can describe, more of a feeling of excitement and the buzzing
            of people all excited for the same thing that you are is just a really cool feeling to experience. I never 
            got the chance to see them live again before the passing of Chester, but I will always be thankful that I
            got to see them at the beginning of their journey. </p>

        <h2>Metallica with Godsmack</h2>

            <p>I saw Metallica with godsmack at the hockey arena back when i was in high school. It was neat cause it was only those
            two bands that played. Each one played for over ana hour. Godsmack did a drum solo, more of a drum battle if you 
            will, between the drummer and the lead singer, each would try to outdo the other and then the crowd picked the
            winner of the round and they would do it again. Metallica had just come out with their St. Anger album (ugh) but
            they played all their classics as well. I remember my friend i went with wanted me to come to the restroom with 
            her during the guitar solo of 'One' I told her she was out of her mind. Who does that? Oh well. </p>

        <h2>I won free tickets on the radio!</h2>

            <p>The most recent concert I went to was A Day to Remember with Papa Roach, Falling in Reverse and The Devil
            Wears Prada. That was the second time I had seen Falling in Reverse and Papa Roach. Both bands have such 
            a high energy and an amazing stage presence you cant help but enjoy the show. The coolest thing about this
            concert though, was that I had won tickets on the radio. I was driving home from work one morning listening
            <a href="http://viperrocks.com/">The Viper</a> and texted in. This time I actually got a text back saying I had won the tickets. I thought it was
            really cool because I had never won any tickets before on the radio. What was cooler was that I got to go 
            to the radio station to pick them up. The studio was painted red, I got to meet Tom West (who used to work
            for The Point) and look around.
